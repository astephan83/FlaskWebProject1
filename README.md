# FlaskWebProject1
Critical issue:
- Flask cannot import pyowm like it can using a normal python file. Need to make api for it according to Flask documentation at:
  http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/extensiondev/
  
- Need login and settings html added to template folder
- Need to add radio buttons to main html for temperatures.
- Add general dynamic functions to pages to handle events 
- Need to create login queries
